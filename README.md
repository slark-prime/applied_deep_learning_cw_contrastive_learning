The repository includes three main directories:

1. `Finetune`: Contains the code for fine-tuning a pre-existing neural network model, on a Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, semantic segmentation task.
2. `Pretrain`: Houses code related to pretraining a model using a contrastive learning approach SimCLR, which is a method for learning visual representations.
3. `Figures`: Stores experimental data and results that are referenced in the project's report, which could include graphs, charts, and other visualizations of the model's performance.\
4. Link to 0.55,0.7,0.85 model is stated in the `README.md` file of Finetune folder.
